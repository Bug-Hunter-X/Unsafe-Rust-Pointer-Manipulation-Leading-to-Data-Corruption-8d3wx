This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to unsafe code and pointer manipulation. The `bug.rs` file showcases the incorrect usage of raw pointers to modify a vector, potentially leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` provides a safe and correct solution that avoids direct pointer manipulation and instead leverages Rust's safe abstractions for data manipulation.
